**Lucas Kjaero-Zhang** I'm a committed data scientist with a strong technical background and a broadly focused undergraduate education. I will use technically sound data analysis with an eye to what makes the data important. I was a fellow at Carnegie Mellon analyzing traffic data, and have worked on projects in diverse areas such as stock trading algorithms and Mandarin Chinese. Our team's stock trading algorithm made $10,000 (virtual) in the first week of testing. I'm passionate about bringing valuable and actionable insights from your data. I work best with teams. I look forward to working with you.
