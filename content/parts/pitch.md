I'm a full stack engineer with a focus on data and a broad variety of experience. I will build robust systems that effectively collect and clean your data.

I have worked at enterprise scale for two years, and have worked on roles in diverse areas such as application development, devops, and quality. The application I maintained and improved has performed over 1 million deployments, and I know that because I built the metrics pipeline for it.

I'm passionate about bringing valuable and actionable insights from your data. I work best with teams.

I look forward to working with you.
