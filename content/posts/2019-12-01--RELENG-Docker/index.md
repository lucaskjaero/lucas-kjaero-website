#Description
Created a suite of docker containers allowing new hires to begin local development on day one. Prior to the docker setup, local development was a pain point, with no team-member having all microservices set up locally, and development frequently occurred in local environments
#What I learned
- How to dockerize spring boot applications.
- How to recreate a microservice architecture locally using docker-compose.
