#Description
Created an object-oriented Python program to solve sliding tile puzzles with an A* search and multiple heuristics. Finds solutions with the fewest possible number of moves.
#What I learned
I learned how to model problems as search problems, and use classic Artificial Intelligence approaches to solve them.
