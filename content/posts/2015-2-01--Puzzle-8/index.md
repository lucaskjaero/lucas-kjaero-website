#Description
Created an object-oriented Python program to solve sliding tile puzzles with an A* search and multiple heuristics. Finds solutions with the fewest possible number of moves.
#What I learned
- How to model problems as graphs and search problems.
- How to use classic Artificial Intelligence approaches to solve them.
