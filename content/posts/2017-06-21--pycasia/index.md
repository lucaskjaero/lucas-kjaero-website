#Description
An open-source python library to work with the CASIA Chinese handwriting database. Reads custom binary filetypes to prepare for machine learning applications.
#What I learned
- I learned how to read custom binary file types using only a specification.
- I learned how to package and publish python code to the Python Package Index.
