#Description
Created a suite of performance testing scripts for Free File Fillable Forms. Used these scripts to prepare the site for the predicted traffic of the 2017 tax season as the team's sole performance engineer.
#What I learned
- How to write complex programs in scala.
- How to test the performance of a website, both in peak and endurance scenarios.
- FMEA testing - seeing what will happen if various component services go down, to plan for potential outages.
