title: About me
---
I'm a full stack engineer with a focus on data and a broad variety of experience. I will build robust systems that effectively collect and clean your data.

I have worked at enterprise scale for two years, and have worked on roles in diverse areas such as application development, devops, and quality. The application I maintained and improved has performed over 1 million deployments, and I know that because I built the metrics pipeline for it.

When I'm not maintaining the release pipelines at Intuit, I love traveling, going on long walks with my family, and automating everything possible in my house. I've lived in 3 1/2 countries and want to one day have lived on every continent. (Maybe not Antarctica)
