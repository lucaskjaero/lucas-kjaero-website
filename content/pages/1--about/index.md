title: About Me
---
I'm a full stack engineer with a focus on data and a broad range of experience. I am able to build robust systems that effectively collect and clean data.

I have worked at enterprise scale for two years, and have worked in a variety of roles including application development, devops, and quality. The deployment tool I maintained and improved has performed over 1 million deployments within the company, and I know that because I built the data collection infrastructure for it.

I've lived on 3 continents and speak four languages. When I'm not working, I love traveling, cooking new foods, learning languages, and automating everything possible in my house.
