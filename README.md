## Well-rounded with a love of data

I'm a full stack engineer with a focus on data and a broad variety of experience. I will build robust systems that effectively collect and clean your data.

I have worked at enterprise scale for three years, and have worked in a variety of roles including application development, devops, and quality. The deployment tool I maintained and improved has performed over 1 million deployments within the company, and I know that because I built the data collection infrastructure for it.

I'm passionate about bringing valuable and actionable insights from your data. I work best with teams.

I look forward to working with you.
